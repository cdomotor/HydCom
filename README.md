## Troubleshooting Camera Issues

If the camera view shows a blank screen even after granting permissions:

1. Reinstall the camera module to ensure it is properly linked:

   ```bash
   expo install expo-camera
   ```

2. Restart the Expo development server:

   ```bash
   npx expo start -c
   ```

3. Force quit and reopen the Expo Go app on your device.
